                        <p class="pb_10"><span class="t_bold">General Information and Definitions.</span> The Forever Rewarded Loyalty Program ("Program") allows you to earn reward points ("Points") on the dollars you spend as described in Section 3 below, using your Forever 21 Credit Card or Forever 21 Visa Credit Card Account ("Account"). For every 300 points accumulated at the end of an earning period, you will automatically receive a $5 Rewards Certificate ("Certificates") that can be used at any Forever 21 store in the U.S. (excluding U.S. territories) and online at www.forever21.com, as specified in Sections 4 and 5 below.</p>
                        <p class="pb_10">While the Program may be related to your Forever 21 Credit Card or Forever 21 Visa Credit Card Account Agreement ("Agreement"), which governs the use of your Forever 21 Credit Card or Forever 21 Visa Credit Card ("Card"), these Program Terms are separate and independent from your Agreement. In the event of any conflict between these Program Terms and your Agreement, these Terms will control in any matter relating to the Program.</p>
                        <p class="pb_10">In these Program Terms, "you" and "your" mean the Account holder. "We," "our," and "us" mean Forever 21 Inc. or its successors or assignees. "Bank" means Comenity Capital Bank or its successors or assignees. Other capitalized words not specifically defined have the same meaning as in your Agreement.</p>
                        <p class="pb_10">There is no additional cost to you to participate in the Program. See your Credit Card Agreement for any fees that you may incur for using your Forever 21 Credit Card or Forever 21 Visa Credit Card.</p>

Your Forever Rewarded membership will be renewed automatically each year as long as your Account is in Good Standing and we continue to offer the Program, unless you notify us of cancellation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Program Terms, we reserve the right to approve, deny or revoke membership in the Program to any individual at any time and for any reason whatsoever.</p>

Each merchant – that is a retailer, business or any other place where you can make a purchase – is assigned a code that indicates the merchant's area of business. For example, gas stations and restaurants are each generally assigned a specific merchant code. We don't assign or have any control over merchant codes. Merchant codes are chosen and assigned by a third party, who may change the codes from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we are provided the code for the merchant. If the merchant code matches a category that gives you additional rewards, you will receive the additional rewards points for that purchase. Because we don't control what code a merchant is assigned, sometimes a purchase that you think fits a certain category may not earn additional rewards points. If you have any questions about whether a purchase qualified as a restaurant purchase, please call us at <a href="tel:+18664125563">1-866-412-5563 ☎</a> (TDD/TTY <a href="tel:+18888191918">1-888-819-1918 ☎</a>).</p>

                            <p><span class="t_bold">1 Point for each $1.00 of Net New Purchases made everywhere else Visa is accepted.</span></p>
                            <p class="pb_10"><span class="t_pink">Net New Purchases"</span> means purchases of goods and/or services, including taxes and shipping charges, made by you or any Authorized User on your Account minus any returns, refunds or credit adjustments, rounded to the nearest dollar. Points awarded for purchases that are returned, refunded, or otherwise adjusted will be deducted from your Points total. Such deductions may result in a negative Points balance, in which case, any Points you earn will be applied to reduce that balance and you will not be able to redeem Points until you again have a positive balance. Purchases that are returned that receive merchandise store credit will not have any Points adjusted.</p>
                            <p class="pb_10">Points are not earned on: gift cards, e-certificates, balance transfers, convenience checks, cash advances, overdraft advances, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, purchases of money orders, travelers checks, foreign currency, quasi-cash or other cash equivalents, purchases made by or for a business or for a business purpose; fraudulent transactions; and transactions subject to adjustment; or on interest or fees of any kind, such as finance charges, late payment fees, and cash advance fees.</p>
                            <p class="pb_10">We may from time to time make special offers for you to earn additional Points on specific purchases. The terms and conditions for such special offers (such as which purchases qualify and the number of additional Points you may earn) will be disclosed at the time of offer. Please check those terms and conditions carefully, as there may be important conditions or limitations (such as blackout periods, point limitations or exclusions). Availability of any special offer is subject to change without notice.</p>
                            <p class="pb_10">Points are considered earned when they are posted to your Points balance, which generally will be on the same day that the purchase is posted to your Account. However, Points may take up to 3-5 days to be posted following a qualifying purchase. We reserve the right to verify and adjust Points at any time prior to or following posting or redemption. Your Points balance will be updated daily and is shown on your billing statement and online at <a href="https://d.comenity.net/forever21/"><span class="underline">comenity.net/forever21</span></a> or <a href="https://d.comenity.net/forever21visa/"><span class="underline">comenity.net/forever21visa</span></a>.</p>

                            <p class="pb_10"><span class="t_bold">Rewards Certificate Use.</span> Rewards points will automatically be redeemed for Rewards Certificates when the 300 point threshold is met. Rewards Certificates are issued in $5 increments via your monthly billing statement.</p>

                            <p class="pb_10">Points will be issued on a "first in, first out" basis, such that the first Points earned will be the first Points used towards a rewards certificate. There is no limit to the rewards certificate value that can be issued during an earning period, and all points below the rewards certificate threshold will be carried over to the following statement period.</p>
                            <p class="pb_10">Once a Rewards Certificate is issued, your Points balance will be reduced by the number of Points used to obtain the Certificate. In the event a return, refund, or credit adjustment results in insufficient Points at the time for the Certificate to be issued, the Certificate may not be issued. If the Certificate is issued and we later discover that you did not have sufficient Points for the Certificate(s) in your Points balance, in addition to any other actions we may take, future Points earnings will be applied to the Certificate(s) until such time as sufficient Points are earned to cover the Certificate(s). You will not be able to redeem Points until you again have a positive balance. Purchases that are returned that receive merchandise store credit will not have any Points adjusted.</p>
                            <p class="pb_10">Points you earn may not be combined with Points earned by anyone else for purposes of receiving Rewards. Points earned have no cash value, and cannot be purchased, sold or redeemed for cash. Points may not be used as payment of any outstanding obligations to the Bank or its affiliates.</p>
                            <p class="pb_10">You may only receive a rewards certificate if your Account is Current. If your Account is not Current, you will not be eligible to receive them until the end of the billing period in which your Account is once again Current. <span class="t_pink">"Current"</span> means your Account (1) is open to new charges, (2) is not delinquent or in default under the Agreement, (3) does not have a balance over the assigned credit limit, and (4) is not flagged as lost, stolen, or fraudulent according to Bank's written or electronic records.</p>
                            <p class="pb_10">Rewards certificates are not transferable and each rewards certificate is redeemable per its terms.</p>

                            <p class="pb_10"><span class="t_bold">Point Expiration and Forfeiture.</span> Points below the rewards certificate threshold will be carried over to the following statement period. <span class="t_bold t_pink">However, Points will expire 24 months after the date that they are earned.</span> Once Points expire, they may no longer be used. You will also forfeit your unused and unexpired Points if you attempt to violate the prohibitions on the transfer of Points, if you file for bankruptcy, or if the Bank or you close your Account for any reason. You will not be entitled to and will not receive any compensation from us for your Points that expire or are forfeited.</p>

Rewards have no cash value and may not be applied to gift cards, e-certificates, taxes, or shipping charges. Rewards will not be honored retroactively in connection with any prior purchases. Lost, stolen, or expired rewards certificates are not replaceable.  A rewards certificate is combinable with the Forever 21 employee discount. <span class="t_pink t_bold">Rewards certificates expire 60 days after they are issued.</span></p>

If you believe that a purchase made on your Account should have resulted in the addition of Points to your Points balance, and such Points are not reflected in the Points balance within forty-five (45) days of the date on which the purchase posted to your Points balance ("Points Dispute"), notify the Bank immediately. The Bank will use reasonable efforts to investigate your Points Dispute so long as you notify us of such dispute within ninety (90) days of the posting date of such purchase. If you do not notify the Bank within such ninety (90)-day period, you will have waived your right to make a Points Dispute with respect to that purchase. In order for the Bank to undertake an investigation of your Points Dispute, the Bank may require you to provide written confirmation of the dispute. If the Bank does not receive the requested written confirmation at the address and within the time requested, the Bank may in sole discretion determine not to investigate your Points Dispute. Upon completion of the investigation of your Points Dispute, the Bank will have no further responsibilities should you later reassert the same Points Dispute. <strong>All disputes related to the Program are subject to the Jury Trial Waiver and Arbitration Provision in your Agreement.</strong></p>
