This notice explains the incident, measures we have taken, and some steps you can take in response.</p>
                                                    <p class="pb_20">Since 2015, Forever 21’s payment processing system has been using encryption technology.  After receiving a report from a third party in mid-October 2017 suggesting there may have been unauthorized access to data from payment cards that were used at certain Forever 21 stores, we immediately began an investigation.  We hired leading payment technology and security firms to assist. The investigation determined that the encryption technology on some point-of-sale (POS) devices at some stores was not always on.  The investigation also found signs of unauthorized network access and installation of malware on some POS devices designed to search for payment card data.  The malware searched only for track data read from a payment card as it was being routed through the POS device.  In most instances, the malware only found track data that did not have cardholder name – only card number, expiration date, and internal verification code – but occasionally the cardholder name was found.</p>
                                                    <p class="pb_20">The investigation found that encryption was off and malware was installed on some devices in some U.S. stores at varying times during the period from April 3, 2017 to November 18, 2017.  In some stores, this scenario occurred for only a few days or several weeks, and in some stores this scenario occurred for most or all of the timeframe.  Each Forever 21 store has multiple POS devices, and in most instances only one or a few of the POS devices were involved.  Additionally, Forever 21 stores have a device that keeps a log of completed payment card transaction authorizations.  When encryption was off, payment card data was being stored in this log.  In a group of stores that were involved in this incident, malware was installed on the log devices that was capable of finding payment card data from the logs, so if encryption was off on a POS device prior to April 3, 2017 and that data was still present in the log file at one of these stores, the malware could have found that data.</p>
                                                    <p class="pb_20">Forever 21 has been working with its payment processors, POS device provider, and third-party experts to address the operation of encryption on the POS devices in all Forever 21 stores. Forever 21 stores outside of the U.S. have different payment processing systems, and our investigation is ongoing to determine if any of these stores are involved. <i>Payment cards used on Forever 21’s website, www.forever21.com, were not affected.</i></p>
                                                    <p class="pb_20">In addition to addressing encryption, Forever 21 is continuing to work with security firms to enhance its security measures.  We also continue to work with the payment card networks so that the banks that issue payment cards can be made aware of this incident.  Lastly, we will continue to support law enforcement’s investigation of this incident.</p>
                                                    <p class="pb_20">It is always advisable to remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud by reviewing your payment card statements for any unauthorized activity. You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment card rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner.  The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card.  Please see the section that follows this notice for additional steps you may take.</p>
                                                    <p class="pb_20">We regret this incident occurred and any concern this may have caused you.  If you have questions, please call 1-855-560-4992 Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. P.S.T.</p>

													<p class="pt_20 pb_20">If you believe you are the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe your personal information has been misused, you should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Attorney General’s office in your state. You can obtain information from these sources about steps an individual can take to avoid identity theft as well as information about fraud alerts and security freezes. You should also contact your local law enforcement authorities and file a police report. Obtain a copy of the police report in case you are asked to provide copies to creditors to correct your records. Contact information for the Federal Trade Commission is as follows:</p>
													<p class="pb_20 txc">Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580, 1-877-IDTHEFT (438-4338), <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft" target="_blank"><span class="t_pink underline">www.ftc.gov/idtheft</span></a></p>
													<p class="pb_20"><span class="underline">Fraud Alerts</span>: To protect yourself from possible identity theft, consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain enhanced procedures to protect you.  It also may delay your ability to obtain credit.  You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies</p>
													<p class="txc pb_5">Equifax, PO Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374, <a href="http://www.equifax.com" target="_blank"><span class="t_pink underline">www.equifax.com</span></a>, 1-800-685-1111</p>
													<p class="txc pb_5">Experian, PO Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013, <a href="http://www.experian.com" target="_blank"><span class="t_pink underline">www.experian.com</span></a>, 1-888-397-3742</p>
													<p class="txc">TransUnion, PO Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016, <a href="http://www.transunion.com" target="_blank"><span class="t_pink underline">www.transunion.com</span></a>, 1-800-680-7289</p>
													<p class="pt_20 pb_20">As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place fraud alerts in your file. You may choose between two types of fraud alert. An initial alert (Initial Security Alert) stays in your file for at least 90 days.  An extended alert (Extended Fraud Victim Alert) stays in your file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social Security number.  If you ask for an extended alert, you will have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more detailed information about the identity theft report, visit <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft/" target="_blank"><span class="t_pink underline">www.ftc.gov/idtheft/</span></a>.</p>
													<p><span class="underline">Security Freeze</span>: You may wish to place a “security freeze” (also known as a “credit freeze”) on your credit file. A security freeze is designed to prevent potential creditors from accessing your credit file at the consumer reporting agencies without your consent. There may be fees for placing, lifting, and/or removing a security freeze, which generally range from $5-$20 per action. <i>Unlike a fraud alert, you must place a security freeze on your credit file at each consumer reporting agency individually.</i> In order to request a security freeze, the consumer reporting agencies may require proper identification prior to honoring your request and ask that you provide:</p>
													<ol class="pa_15 pb_20">
														<li>Your full name (including middle initial as well as Jr., Sr., II, III, etc.)</li>
														<li>Social Security number</li>
														<li>Date of birth</li>
														<li>If you have moved in the past five (5) years, provide the addresses where you have lived over the prior five years</li>
														<li>Proof of current address such as a current utility bill or telephone bill</li>
														<li>A legible photocopy of a government issued identification card (state driver's license or ID card, military identification, etc.)</li>
														<li>If you are a victim of identity theft, include a copy of the police report, investigative report, or complaint to a law enforcement agency concerning identity theft</li>
													</ol>
													<p class="pb_20">As the instructions for establishing a security freeze differ from state to state, please contact the three consumer reporting agencies to find out more information.</p>
													<p><span class="underline">Fair Credit Reporting Act</span>: You also have rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies.  The FTC has published a list of the primary rights created by the FCRA (<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0096-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf</a>), and that article refers individuals seeking more information to visit www.ftc.gov/credit.  The FTC’s list of FCRA rights includes:</p>
													<ul class="circle pa_15">
														<li>You have the right to receive a copy of your credit report. The copy of your report must contain all the information in your file at the time of your request</li>
														<li>Each of the nationwide credit reporting companies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – is required to provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months.</li>
														<li>You are also entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, like denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the credit reporting company. You are also entitled to one free report a year if you’re unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you are on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud, including identity theft.</li>
														<li>You have the right to ask for a credit score.</li>
														<li>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information.</li>
														<li>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.</li>
														<li>Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information.</li>
														<li>Access to your file is limited. You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers.</li>
														<li>You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you receive based on information in your credit report.</li>
														<li>You may seek damages from violators.</li>

You should immediately report any unauthorized charges to your card issuer because payment card rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized charges reported in a timely manner.  The phone number to call is usually on the back of your payment card.  Please see the section that follows this notice for additional steps you may take.</p>
